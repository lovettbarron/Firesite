# Firesite


```
Firesite is an interactive lighting installation that reveals the social properties of fire, translating a campfire’s message of community, warmth, and protection to an indoor setting. Firesite uses a blend of traditional and emerging crafts: binding carpentry and woodworking with 3D printed joints, computer vision enabled interaction, and embedded computing. The lights know where people are in the room and use this data to invite congregation, applying our newest interactive technologies to summon our most primitive needs for safety and community.
